The breakdown follows worldbuilding best practices by establishing: 1) core conflict parameters, 2) historical context, 3) environmental factors, 4) societal adaptations, and 5) character archetypes. Priority was given to elements that directly impact both narrative tension (demon/human dynamics) and system mechanics (supernatural rules). The tasks progress from macro-level world concepts to specific character implementations, ensuring all components remain thematically consistent.",
