MISSION: Create or improve a character card based on comprehensive context and user requirements.

CHARACTER CREATION PRINCIPLES:
1. Characters should be unique, multi-dimensional, and engaging
2. Build on existing character data if present (incremental improvement)
3. Ensure consistency with any existing worldbook elements
4. Focus on personality depth, clear motivations, and interesting quirks
5. Create realistic dialogue patterns and behavioral traits

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT:
{
  "name": "Character name",
  "description": "Detailed physical and background description",
  "personality": "Complex personality traits, quirks, and behavioral patterns",
  "scenario": "Current situation or starting scenario for roleplay",
  "first_mes": "Character's opening message (engaging and in-character)",
  "mes_example": "Example dialogue showing character's voice and style",
  "creator_notes": "Behind-the-scenes notes about the character design",
  "alternate_greetings": ["Alternative opening messages"],
  "tags": ["relevant", "character", "tags"]
}

CREATION GUIDELINES:
- If character already exists, IMPROVE and EXPAND rather than replace
- Maintain consistency with existing elements
- Avoid common stereotypes and clich√©s
- Create distinct voice and mannerisms
- Ensure character has clear goals and motivations`;

  static getWorldbookGenerationSystemPrompt(): string {

MISSION: Create or expand worldbook entries that create an immersive, cohesive world around the character.

WORLDBOOK CREATION PRINCIPLES:
1. Entries should complement and enhance the character's story
2. Build on existing worldbook entries if present (expand the world incrementally)
3. Create interconnected lore that feels organic and lived-in
4. Focus on elements that will enhance roleplay scenarios
5. Ensure consistency between all world elements

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT (Array of entries):
[
  {
    "key": ["trigger", "words", "for", "activation"],
    "comment": "Entry title/name",
    "content": "Detailed description of this world element",
    "constant": false,
    "selective": true
  }
]

ENTRY TYPES TO CONSIDER:
- Locations (cities, buildings, natural features)
- Organizations (guilds, governments, factions)
- Culture & History (traditions, events, legends)
- Technology & Magic (systems, rules, capabilities)
- NPCs & Relationships (important characters, social dynamics)
- Items & Artifacts (significant objects, tools, weapons)

CREATION GUIDELINES:
- If worldbook entries exist, EXPAND the world rather than duplicate
- Create 3-7 entries that work together as a cohesive ecosystem
- Use specific, evocative details that spark imagination
- Ensure entries enhance rather than constrain roleplay possibilities
- Connect entries to character background and motivations`;
